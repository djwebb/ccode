README.CESM_01
==============

    This directory contains the changed version of routine "baroclinic.F"
    used for the forced run of the CESM model described in my paper titled
      "On the response of the Equatorial Atmosphere and Ocean to
      changes in Sea Surface Temperature along the Path of the North
      Equatorial Counter Current"

    The file should be placed under the top directory generated by the
    CESM 'create_newcase' command in directory "/SourceMode/src.pop/".
